Title: Daylight savings time visualised
Blurb: What is Daylight Saving actually doing in Australia
Tags:InfoVis

Every year on the first Sunday of October, the lower East and Southern states and territories of Australia observe Daylight Savings Time (DST). Every year the there is some debate about Queensland adopting the practice. Every year the same arguments get bandied out. Lets look at what DST actually looks like.

This is the sunrise and sunset times plotted over about two years to a reasonable accuracy for my home town of Brisbane. Blue area is time with the sun has technical set but twilight may remain; orange is time at work (assuming one hour lunch so start at 8:30am). Interestingly the Summer (and Winter) Solstice does not fall on the day with the earliest and latest sunrise (and latest and earliest rise/set for Winter). You can see this in the image below as the rise and set patterns are not symmetrical. This is due to the elliptical orbit combined with the tilt of the planet. But that is off topic.

As you can see there is a seasonal variation in total daylight time of about two hours. More importantly for daylight savings, the time after work is about two hours (assuming finishing work at 5pm, which I do for the rest of the article).

This is Melbourne:

Unsurprisingly, due to being much further South, this city has a much bigger range of daylight times. In Summer there is nearly four hours of sunlight after work, while in Winter there is almost no sun (comparable to Brisbane). Interestingly there is nearly three hours of sunlight in the morning.

This time in the morning is where the impetus for DST comes in: that time is wasted before work and would be better served after work.

Perfect: we now have a reasonable mount of daylight before work and nearly five hours of daylight in which to enjoy time not working. Obviously there is no point to doing DST in Winter as there is no 'wasted' daylight to absorb and getting up in the dark is horrible.

Not everything is perfect though. What happens where DST and non-DST areas need to interact: Southern Queensland and Northern NSW, Western SA and Eastern WA. What about [three times zones at one place?][poeppelscorner] (yes, no business would take place there).

This highlights the point of DST though: it is a a helpful system for workers in an <span class="highlight">industrial</span> economy. It makes no sense for agrarian businesses since cows do not care what time your clock says to get up, you get up with the sun. However all farmers need to interact with the outside world so they run into industrial and transport workers at some point and so problems arise there.

Indeed here in Queensland the main resistance is farmers and country workers, saying no while the metropolitan area saying yes. Make sense since those in the west already are an hour (the sun rises an hour later for the same time) behind the east coast and further changes just make things harder. In the last 5 years or so there has a been a small lobbying group established (who have also run as a single issue party in the[2009 election and 2012 south Brisbane by-election][dstparty]. The split time-zone idea makes sense and I would be up for a trial which would look like this:
