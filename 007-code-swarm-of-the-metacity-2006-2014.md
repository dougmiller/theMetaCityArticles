I started the MetaCity website as part of a University project nearly 10 years ago. It has come a long way in that time and I have learnt a lot along with it. This is the Code Swarm of the git history (migrated from SVN ~3 years ago). Thankfully I have the day dot as part of that history.

The repo for this can be found on [my github page][github]. Feel free to do whatever you like with it.

[Code Swarm itself has been around][codeswarm] for a while now too. The main repo is starting to show it's age with compatability issues cropping up. I would reccomend [looking at Peter Burn's fork][ricticswarm] as he has refined a lot of the tools used and brought up minimum versions to something approaching what is availible today. Still on Python 2 but it run without hassle.
