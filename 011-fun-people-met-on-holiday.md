We met fun people on holiday. This is a list of some of them.

## Brown Dog Lady
We were in Verona, walking along the river on our way to see the Dom and the top of the mountain when we crossed paths with an elderly lady being followed by an old brown dog carrying it's own lead. Being a sucker for something that cute, we struck up a conversation with Brown Dog Lady. She had a wonderful knowledge of the city, with it's Roman origins and customs (riding down the centre of town through both gates, which had been moved once cars became common) and the effects of World War 2 that persist to this day.
Brown Dog during this time was torn between continuing to receive pats and also not losing the lead. Any pat would elicit a lean in that reinforced the pat as well as sitting on my foot, however any pat close to the neck or head would start a warning grown, presumable about ownership of the lead in his mouth. Super cute.
We moved once, slightly further up the river to see the repaired bridge and the Roman Amphitheater, meaning Brown Dog, who had laid down had to move. Being old he did not want to move. Liking pats, he wanted to move. Pats won out. As he finally made it to us, tragedy struck as he lay down again and we parted ways. Here was the biggest decision he had to make: follow the newcomers and potentially get more pats or follow his human and get love and food. It took about a hundred meters and a bark or two before he decided to stick with his human. We think she was just super keen to practice her English language skills.

## Mental Illness Milk Lady
Io Gatto ordered a 'latte' at the train station in Milan which immediately confused the attendant. After lots of hand waving and inventing a new sign-language she got what she ordered: a cup of hot milk with *no*  coffee. A milk coffee in Italy is a *caffè* latte. We abandoned the milk and moved outside to order lunch and a coffee somewhere else to save face when someone with a clear mental-illness walks into the store. An attendant kicks her out however she immediately follows him back in and begs for the abandoned milk. The attendant sees us and we deny ownership of the milk and so he relents to giving her said milk. On her way past us, now brandishing a cup of hot milk, a small song of 'latte, latte, latte…' can be heard.

## Italian Army Dad
We sat in a beach side cafe in Vernazza after a three kilometre walk from Monterosso. The whole area is some of the most beautiful seaside landscapes you will see. Signs indicate that it should be 90 minutes however I would argue that is for native mountain people and not fat and lazy tourists (German food will do that to a person).

Regardless, next to us was a family of three (Mum, Dad and Three Year Old) that were having a great time in the sun, clearly only there for the afternoon (talking to him later, they only lived a hundred or so kilometres away). They were playing with the napkins, eating great food and drinking great drinks.

He looked about as stereotypical as you can get: slicked back hair, wrap around sunglasses, olive tanned skin, the works. He was having a great time playing with his son, inventing games and fooling around. Every so often however he would glance at us and shy away a little bit. Weird.

When he went to pay however he offered to pay for our drinks as he felt that he was disturbing our romantic afternoon with his jiving. We tried to protest saying that we were not disturbed at all but he was having non of it.

We started to talk and after learning we were from Australia he revealed that his sister in law was living in Sydney and they had visited her and also travelled to Byron Bay, their dream home. I have no idea why you would leave the area around Cinco Terra.
He then picked me for military (my bag gave it away) and he revealed that he had been in the Army and had also been deployed to Afghanistan under an Australian SF commander.

<aside>The actual path is about 3.5 km long and from sea level up to about 160m and back again a couple of times. This length is divided in to 25 sections, each marked with a sign. We did not know this until the end where there is a big notice board explaining all this. Anyway, we are about two thirds up the first and biggest hill about an hour into the walk, when Io Gatto asks someone coming from the other direction is we are near the end yet; we could be as we have not see an accurate, to scale map or know how many markers in the signs. Her (American) response: 'Oh honey, no… no…'</aside>

## Oranges guy
Once on top of the hills on the coast, the walk become much more manageable and quite relaxing, however the Sun and initial ascent take it's toll. So when about a third of the way through the walk, a local orange farmer had run an extension lead from his farm above the path and was powering a juicer for the oranges he had pick from his trees that morning. There was no way to deny him.

He didn't talk, however he did recognise joy and gratitude when observing the look on peoples faces when they imbibe his ambrosia. This oranges were really fantastic.

## French Guy
Quite often when we go on holiday, we end up running into the same people or groups and staying in step with them. This is not surprising: we stay in popular places and do popular things. Last time it happened was Tasmania with a family of five: Father, Mother, Eldest Child, and Identical Twins (fantastically the Twins had swapped one shoe each and wore their hair the same way).
This time it was the French Guy and his Wife. We first ran into them at dinner the first night we stayed in Montoroso. This guy exuded Frenchness: his size, his eating style, the clothes he wore, the lot! The stereotype was magnificent to behold.  Next time was breakfast the next day; no biggie, the restaurant was attached to the hotel. Then the town of Como, certainly a popular and obvious place, that afternoon, including a casual head nod to acknowledge the encounter. 
Of course we saw him the next day in Menzi. I believe in situations like this, the casual awkwardness needs to be called out, so upon seeing him and Wife on the sightseeing train, I bellow a hearty 'bon journo' much to his chagrin and the amusement of Wife.
*We* didn't see them again.

## The Professor
At said restaurant in Montoroso there was also a man dubiously dubbed The Professor. His tawdry coat, rotund belly and pale complexion screamed professor. But professor of what? Io Gatto had an idea: his thesis was a comparison of the effectiveness of the Dewey decimal system and sorting by spine colour. Turns out his research showed that colour coding sorting was much more effective than the old tried and trusted Dewey Decimal System. Who knew?

He was English which makes this so much better.

## Berlin tour guy
English dude a season out of university was conducting the tour, who has discovered that a degree in philosophy does not an easily employed person make. So he is doing the Summer tour circuit for a season before heading back to the UK for another look at work. Very nicely summed up the culture, history, and zeitgeist of the city. I think philosophy has served him well.

## Coffee lady
I ordered a caffè latte, soya, decaf. The woman making the coffee was not impressed.

## Peppermint tea lady
My Aunt lives and works in London, England. Obviously we visited her and spent some time touring around London. Next to my Aunt's house there is a kilometers long canal, complete with locks and a really nice community that revolves around said canal; from people living in long boats that travel up and down the country to schools that use the canal as a social conduit, age old derelict workshops strewn with burnt out bricks and timer and hyper modern apartment complexes resplendent in their plastic and steel.
In one of the many nooks and crannies lived a small tea and cake shop, no bigger than a small bus, set into the side of a building straddling the canal. On unknowably deliberate or not reclaimed seats and tables we sat in the afternoon sun, watching a longboat sputter down the canal off to parts unknown and a heron search for fish I ordered a peppermint tea. She only had fresh. Upon seeing her reach down and pull out some peppermint leaves off the shrub next to her and put it into my cup, I realised I didn't know what I expected otherwise.
