Title: So you deleted your clients production website
Blurb: What to do if you accidentally delete your clients production website

Step that might be helpful if you accidentally delete your clients production site.

## Step 1: Don't panic
While scary and gut wrenching, panicking will only make the situation worse. The first thing is to take stock of what has happened. Has the site really truly been deleted or has something less nasty happened? Is there an immediate solution?

## Step 2: Talk to your client
Pick up the phone and all the client. Get ahead of them on this. Do not wait for them to try and use the site only to see nothing appear. Call them.

Explain that you fucked up. Explain that they are now your number one client until this has been fixed (they were already #1 right? Right?).

## Step 3: Get to work
Give them a plan to get the site back. "We are going to restore from backup. It will take ~1 hour."

Keep them informed. Stay on the phone if it is going to be done in the next ten minutes otherwise ring them with an update every ten (or whatever they want). Do not leave them thinking you have run off. Even if you do not have new information, let them know that you have nothing new. They need to know you are still working for them.

## Step 4: Apologise and improve
Once the dust has settled after the site is backup send them an apology bottle of their intoxicant of choice and an explanation accepting fault and an explanation of the changes to policy that means this wont happen again.

Failing all that: hope your indemnity insurance is paid up

Thankfully I have never deleted a production site. This article was inspired by an event where someone else at the place I worked at at the time did so on a Friday morning while cleaning up old accounts on a shared hosting server. The usual process in this situation failed as the backups did not work (site was ~5 years old and the backups were incremental diffs which fell on their face when submitted for restoration). The site was down for ~30 hours before a copy of the Wayback Machine could be downloaded nd put in it's place. The backups were eventually fixed and the site was restored after ~48 hours. The new policy is to suspend accounts for a year before deletion and also to have a copy of the account on a local (in the office) removable drive. Saved us a couple of time (and been profitable once when a client from a few years previous came back).
