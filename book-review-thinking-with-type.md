Title: Book review: Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton
Blurb: this book is held in pretty high esteem whenever introduction to Typography is mentioned. Does it stack up? Kinda.

# Book Review: Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton
TLDR: It does a fine job of describing the technical aspects of what constitutes type but falls down on the 'thinking with' part.


There seems to be one sentence that comes close "The font to use is situation dependant" which seems to talk to the title but does no further. So that's nice.
