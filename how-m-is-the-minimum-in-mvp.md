Title: How M is your M in MVP?
Tags: Business, Design
Blurb: You might, on occasion, have a client come to you asking for an MVP. Your idea of an MVP might differ from theirs. How big a difference there is should probably be worked out pretty quickly.

Do the absolute minimum needed to validate the concept with the hardest constraints: manual processes, faked data, canned responses.

Too often we see assumptions about technology where solving for 1 and not 100000 or 0 or -1 or ABC or NULL.

We also see 'Action Procrastination' buy doing all the tasks around the problem (logins, bike-shedding on colours, all sorts of nonsense that does not contribute to the minimum viable product).

"But i need something to sell to my boss": Be better at your job. Frame it as avoiding risk. 1/100 now to avoid 80/100 and realising it wont work.

I will still take your money though.
