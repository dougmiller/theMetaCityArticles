You have done some design work and it is now time to present it to the client. Here is how to survive and thrive.

## Do a rehearsal
Take the time to go through what you are going to present to the client. Do it like you would for real at least once. Check your tech is all working and 

## You are in charge. Act like it.
Not to mean to be a control freak but you called the meeting so make it worth peoples time

## Set the agenda
Invite only the needed people
Be draconian ("No Steve, you cant just come in because you are vaguely involved. If 
I need you there I will invite you.")
  Don't let invitees invite people because the think they might be needed

Give people present jobs/tasks to do (see above)  
  Why else would they need to be there?
  Ask for specific feedback on specific items before the presentation starts
    "Max (from Ops), could you please keep an eye out for features where the technology would cause an issue with what is currently available"
    "Sam (from marketing), could you please let me know if the structure of the site fits with current positioning."

  Take questions during or after? Could go either way. Depends on trust (not to derail the presentation).

Avoid point and say presentations ("Here is the logo, here is the footer which is now blue, here is the menu...."). Do present higher level ideas and concepts, especially backed up with rational/justification: "We have moved the search to be front and centre of the index page because 80% of users do search as their first action on the site. While this is less-than-ideal, we don't have the budget or timeline to redevelop the site structure to make search unnecessary; we will spend the rest of this round of work improving search experience. |Cue developer in the room if there are technical issues that would need to be addressed around changes to search|. We propose to work on the issues around making search unnecessary in Q1 next year."

<aside>Controversial opinion: If you are developing without data or goals or actual user feedback, you are not doing Design, you are doing an Art Project and should feel bad about yourself.</aside>

If you finish early, finish.
