Title: It is OK that your site looks different in different browsers
Blurb: You are going to have to convince the client that their site is going to look different in different browsers.
Tags:Web Design,Business

You have all had the conversation with your client that goes something like this:

INT. OFFICE - 4:55pm.
Web developer at desk, back to camera, clearly packing up ready to leave to the week.
Phone rings.

D: "Afternoon, this is {{ Doug @ the MetaCity speaking }}"
C: "Hi this is Client. We just noticed that the blue bar on the screen is two pixels lower on IE then it is on Chrome. We need this fixed ASAP before someone notices."
D: Dies inside.

Your (their) site is going to look different in different browsers. You are going to have to accept that because it always has.

You need to assuage the client that this is OK. It is better for everyone.

## The dumbest part
Your site already looks different and it always has. People have different resolution monitors, run windows at different dimensions, have all different devices (desktop, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, fucking fridges somehow), have different colour depths, run it through accessibility tools, the list goes on. Given that experience people have with site, do you really think that they are going to open your site in two different browsers, match dimensions of the windows and see the couple of pixels difference and close both windows and complain about it to everyone. It won't cost a sale.

## The obvious part
If the site is completely broken on one browser than it obviously needs to be fixed. If they have paid for a feature then they get the feature. That is not what I am talking about here.

## The hard part
Your client doesn't know any of the above. All they know is that they have paid for a design to be implemented and because they have never known any different, they are expecting pixel perfect to the design (probably at only one resolution). They will then have to have it signed off by their boss who is in the same boat.

The hard part and an important soft skill of your job is that you have to sell them on value for time spent. Is it worth spending three person hours fixing the padding on the footer menu in a browser with < 2% usage (for their site) or spending the same time on optimising the sales funnel further?
