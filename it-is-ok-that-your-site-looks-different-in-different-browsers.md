# It is OK that your site looks different in different browsers

Your site already looks different. You will need to accept that.

You have all had the conversation with your client that goes something like this:

INT. OFFICE - 4:55pm.
WS developer at desk, back to camera, clearly packing up ready to leave to the week.
Phone rings.

D: "Afternoon, this is {{ Doug @ the MetaCity speaking }}"
C: "Hi this is Client. We just noticed that the blue bar on the screen is two pixels lower on IE then it is on Chrome. We need this fixed ASAP before someone notices."
d: Dies a little.

Your site is going to look different in different browsers. You are going to have to accept that. Because it already does.

You need to assuage the client that this is OK. It is better for everyone.

## The dumbest part
Your site already looks different. People have different resolution monitors, run windows at different dimensions have all different devices (desktop, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, fucking fridges somehow). Given that experience people have with site, do you really think that they are going to open your site in two different browsers, match dimensions of the windows and see the couple of pixels difference and close both windows and complain about it to everyone. It won't cost a sale.

## The hard part
Your client doesn't know all of the above. All they know is that they have paid for a design to be implemented and because they have never known any different, they are expecting pixel perfect to the design. They possibly have to have it signed off by their boss.

The hard part and the main soft skill of your job is that you have to set and manage expectations about what outcomes will likely be right from the beginning. The closer to the deadline (i.e. their deadline) you get the more and more
