# Learning to code for those that already can

With the drive to deliver on knowledge workers for the new post-postindustrial economy of the western world, there appears to be a question that is not being asked. What is the game plan for these that can and do already code.

The answer is probably the usual one: specialise. As with all industries those with specialist skills and qualifications are those that can demand the largest fees and job security.

Race to the specialisation death. Speacialise to outpace the robots replacing jobs.
You should specialise anyway since it willmmake you happier rgardless.
