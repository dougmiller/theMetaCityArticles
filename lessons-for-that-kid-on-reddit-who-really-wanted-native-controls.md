Title: A brief note to young players
Blurb: A followup to a note I left to someone new to this game.
Tags: Philosophy

A while ago I left this note to someone new to the world of development who was frustrated with the speed at which new features are added to web browsers. My original point still stands (be patient, dev is hard) but I regret not adding the below point.

<aside>I have copied in the original discussion for clarity</aside>

The point I would like to add goes like this: the perceived issues you are dealing with are sissiphean in nature. Having the solution in place for this issue wont magically solve all your problems. You will just run into the next one and the next one after that until the day you stop working.

The sign of a maturing dev is one who accepts this reality and works with it to produce software rather than having it be a sticking point.
