# People quit
## It is a matter on when, not if

People in your organisation are going to quit and having undocumented and untested processes that rely on said people is a costly and time consuming mistake.

### How to deal with that

1. Accecpt that people will eventually quit
Burying your head in the sand about it is not going to help. Once you accept this position the rest follows on.

2. Identify your your bus factor for each process that is integral to your business
What happens if Gary, the book keeper, is sick for a week? Is the business able to carry on? Where are all the records kept? In what format? For which program? What is the password to unlock it?

What happens if Jill, you lead developer, gets a better offer in Antarctica and leaves on a midnight plane and is uncontactable? What is the overall architecture of the system, who is doing each part?

One helpful exercise is to get people to describe their roles and responsibilities. This is a hard sell sometimes as it can come of as asking people to justify their work and their role. This process *has* to be framed as one of process improvement and not of scapegoating. 

Time sheets can also be used for this however if the work is not appropriate for this then you are going to run into friction again.

You will get push back from people. This is usually by people who are either insecure about their job because it is either easy to do or they don't know what they are doing in the first place. It is especially important that this be delt with so that the business can move forward.

You will get thanks from people. People who usually get calls on their holiday about some issue or another.
