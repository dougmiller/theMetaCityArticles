Title: People quit
Blurb: People in your organisation are going to quit and having undocumented and untested processes that rely on said people is a costly and time consuming mistake.

## It is a matter on when, not if

To the surprise of no-one, people in your organisation are going to quit (or get fired or die) and having undocumented and untested processes that rely on said people is a costly and time consuming mistake.

## How to deal with that

1. Accept that people will eventually quit
Burying your head in the sand about it is not going to help. Once you accept this position the rest follows on. Yes it is easier to ignore the problem and achieve short term goals but you are in this for the long run, yes?

2. Identify your your bus factor for each process that is integral to your business
What happens if Gary, the book keeper, is sick for a week? Is the business able to carry on? Where are all the records kept? In what format? For which program? What is the password to unlock it?

What happens if Jill, you lead developer, gets a better offer in Antarctica and leaves on a midnight plane and is ex-communicado? What is the overall architecture of the system, who is doing each part?

One helpful exercise is to get people to describe their roles and responsibilities. This is a hard sell sometimes as it can come of as asking people to justify their work and their role. This process *has* to be framed as one of process improvement and not of scapegoating. 

Project management tools/time sheets might be of assistance here. It just has to be accurate and complete (i.e. Sam doesn't bother to add the five minute job of running the calibration of the X as it is so quick and easy).

You will get push back from people. This is usually by people who are either insecure about their job because it is either easy ( don't want to be found out) to do, they don't know what they are supposed to be doing in the first place or people with imposter syndrome. Truly incompetent people are already known correct?. It is especially important that this be dealt with so that the business can move forward.

3. Slow the business down so that the work can be documented and others trained
This will absolutely take longer than normal and be a massive pain for everyone but you will get a few 'aha!' moments as people explain and show what they do to others who will have had no idea. This short term pain is worth doing if you are serious about long term sustainability.

You will get thanks from people. People who usually get calls on their holiday about some issue or another.

You might even find out that other perspectives increase efficiencies as the person might have been doing the job for so long they get stuck in their way. Maybe someone else can do it better.

4. Practice
Send someone on holiday and do not tell the other staff before hand (don't tell the holidayer either if you suspect fraud). Or do if you want a bit easier time. But practice non-the-less.

## What scale?

Doing this for an entire organisation at once is not a great idea (if you are a CEO reading this WTF is wrong with you). Best to limit it to logical units of work. Maybe the UX team this week. Maybe the team responsible for final production sign-off and push swap who pushes the 'go' button fir the next five times. Smaller is faster with less impact but slower overall but also easier to manage. You work it out.
