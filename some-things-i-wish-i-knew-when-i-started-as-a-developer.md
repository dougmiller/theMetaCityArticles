## Get rid of the ego
Coworkers, no one cares that you did X, Y time ago. They only care what you can do to help then now. That does not mean you should not be proud of the work you have done and be excited and passionate about it. Use that passion to continue to do good work but do not fall back on your laurels.

Similarly let go of the idea that you own the code you are working on. Sure, be proud of the excellent work you are doing with it, but you have to be open to the possibility that some one else might also be able to do excellent work with it too and you will have to share the work. they might find bugs in there, or that the design patters or data structures could be improved. Instead, invest in the idea of curating the code. Demand of everyone, including (especially) yourself, that if you are going to touch the code, then you need to be making things better. You are the guy that opens up the code, documents it, tests it, makes it accessible and easy to touch rather than the guy who sits on it and smothers it in complexity and obfuscation. This is your job protection: you are the guy who makes things in this company better for others, you reduce risk, increase productivity rather than the guy who hides behind the siloed information he has accrued.

## Programming is not your only core competency
Writing actual working code is most definitely the reason de jour for you being at that place you are. However there are a few other skills that you need to be cognisant of and at least working towards some kind of skill with to actually become a fully developed developer

### Working well in a team
This means you need to contribute to a team, not be too loud a voice but have a voice non the less.

### Processes that help you program
Source control (GIT/Mercurial, SVN etc). Source control is how you collaborate with coworkers. It is how you can safely and effectivly work togethere on a project and not have the untenable overhead of manually merging files or keeping track of the canonical version.

Documentation of your work is super effective even if you are the only developer on a project becasue you are never the only developer on a project. There is always you and you in six months when you come back to the poeject. There is also the person that will take over you work when you quit (and you will quit), Keeping up to date, accurate and effective documentation will save you a whole load of pain and suffering. It only really needs to be helpful that one time (e.g. this function has a side effect of X, make sure you are dealing with that by doing Y).

Know your editor/IDE and it's strengths and weaknesses. Command line editors (BASH, Emacs, fish etc) all offer amazingly powerful editing capabilities that can take quite a bit of effort to come to grips with. IDEs off some nice user interfaces to get you some nice features at the cost of speed and composability. Putting in the time and effort for the command line tools is incredibly rewarding.

### Sell your code
Being able to sit down and justify the decisions you made in the way you built something is an important skill that will take time to develop. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that selling your design/architecture is going through each file line by line and saying what it does. Instead you need to explain that you used X pattern because it aligns well with Y interactions, Z architecture because of W resources and support available. The code that make this happens falls out of these decisions automatically, 

## Slow down
It is all too easy to
