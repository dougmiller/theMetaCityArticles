# What I learnt from initial training

## The army doesn't celebrate mediocrity
Achieving the standards demanding by training is not celebrated in any way. By definition it is the standard expected. That doesn't mean that there achievement is not celebrated with in the group but there is not official recognition beyond "Good. Next thing#"

### Good enough is not really good enough
To spend your time training and only achieve the minimum standard is really disappointing. Approach the training with an outlook to excel: be physically ready, mentally prepared and have an open attitude to trying hard things.

Physically it is a good idea to be well above the entry requirements for two reasons: the kind of physical work you end up doing is not reflected by the level the entry requirements demand and more importantly, you will lose fitness during your training. Due to the scheduled as well as liability concerns, reservists are not able to engage in physical training outside of the training regieme. Coupled with the training scheduled not having very many (less than half a dozen) dedicated fitness classes you will need to need to be at a standard much higher so that as your fitness comes down, it will remain higher than the standard requires at the end.

Get used to eating the samey kind of food. Don't eat sugar.

It can be a bit harder to train mentally for the training. Forgo access to utilities like phones, watches and the Internet for extended periods (go on a holiday for a week and not use your phone?) and you find your mind begins to calm and let go of the useless things like what is happening on Facebook, Twitter or the news. Being comfortable in this mental state makes the training go faster and easier for the following reason:

## The whole thing is a game
That is not to say you should treat it like a game but you should definitely accept the type of training is not representative of the wider army. This initial foray into the defence force world is designed to get you used to some of the pressures that you may experience and situations you may encounter. The challenge is to be able to separate the 'you' that exists in everyday life, and the 'you' that is getting up at dark o'clock, working for 18 hours then going back to bed. You 'win' this game by meeting all the competencies and not shooting yourself.

The staff know it is a game too. They know they have a roll to play when they are yelling at you and when pushing you, getting you to so things that you might not normally do. Towards the end of training as things begin to relax somewhat they even call themselves on this, pointing out the cognitive dissonance everyone experiences when trying to process the whole experience.

There is a this weird vibe where both the recruits and the staff know this and have a back and forth about it.

## There is a way and that way is good
Because of it's size, some aspects of training and development are steeped in arcane bureaucracy. Things are done because that is the way they are done. It should be noted that the soldiers executing the policy generally know that this policy/procedure is outmoded but have their hand forced. The PTIs for example, know that the exercises they are teaching and training for are at least 10 years behind their civilian counterparts but changes in pols/procs take a commensurate amount of time to filter down from review and control boards. Outside the realm of training, especially in operational theatre, the attitude of improvise, adapt and overcome takes over and the policies that are not helpful are quickly discarded.

## Final thoughts
To do well at this is straight forward. Try. That is it. As one instructor pointed out, "It's the easiest job in the world, just shut up and do what you are told". Just like getting pitched for programming work, ideas are cheap; it is the work that takes the effort.
