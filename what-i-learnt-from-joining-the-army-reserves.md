# Lessons learnt from joining the Australian Defence Force

I joined the ADF as a reservist. This is a journal of some of my experiences.

## Part 1: Specifics
<aside>
The term 'game' in this article refers to one that attempts to simulate an experience as someone tasked with overcoming an opposition with something: ostensibly an FPS, RPG or simulator and not so much tetris.

### Lesson: computer games prime you to approach problems in a bad way
When going through aptitude and attitude testing you are presented with various problems that look to see your approach to solving them vis-à-vis communication, command, respect, etc. The idea is to present you with some situations that you might encounter and then see how your (náive) approach will serve to solve the problem, work in a team and communicate intentions.

Computer games have very different outcomes in mind, crucially entertainment and engagement which, to that end, present problems and manage outcomes in a very different way than what real life demands.

This is not a bad thing in of itself, however it does have a major drawback: it primes you to approach problems with a false set of expectations and experiences that are at odds with reality - to your detriment.

The first part of this is the idea that you are special in your role and purpose. While you as an individual are special and loved; you as a soldier are not very special. You are subject to physical limitation, time constraints and don't re-spawn. In other words you are a real human in the real world with real strength and weaknesses. To mitigate this you need to work in and be part of a team that is supportive and works together. Two things of note follow from this: timing doesn't rotate around you and events do not fall to you.

If a computer game were to be made that followed, you would have to end up with a Real Life Simulator which is extremely boring. Take any first person shooter game and remove the pacing of enemy engagement to have it operate independent of the player and the whole thing falls apart. Have the special events (take the RPG and shoot down the enemy etc.) fall to any other character and you leave the player bored waiting for something to happen. Have the Player not involved in the main plot line and you just end up sitting near the side pointing your gun at civilians and bored out of your mind. You get no achievements in real life: there are no specific combinations of actions to get rewards.

Games work in an artificial world with artificial constraints.

### Lesson: problems are not perfectly solvable
A natural consequence that can fall out of rewards and achievements put in games is the idea all problems are perfectly solvable. Given a level in a game, many

All these aforementioned examples are essential to have in a game but in no way translate to the real world. Without prior experiences, it is all to easy to fall back to this illegitimate experience. To avoid the pitfalls associated with them you need to recognise that you might be affected by them and then put yourself in a position to have them challenged then reflect on your approach.

## Part two: obvious stuff
Government bodies take time to get things done. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. The adage 'Hurry up and wait' exists for a reason. On reflection: the army has ~30 thousand full-time soldiers and ~15 thousand part time soldiers<sup>[1][1]</sup> and organising them is a massive job which surprises me that it works at all. You need to accept that you are a number and will have to go through the process just like everyone else. The flip side of that is that because you are all a number, just like everyone else, you look to those next to you and humanise with them.

The Army will exploit you. But that is OK because you are exploiting them intern too, which is just like any other job. You are trading your time and experience for money. 'Nuff said.
