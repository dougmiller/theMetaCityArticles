Title: What i learn't from initial army training
Tags: discipline

## The army doesn't celebrate mediocrity
Achieving the standards demanding by training is not celebrated in any way. By definition it is the standard expected. That doesn't mean that their achievement is not celebrated within the group but there is not official recognition beyond "Good. Next thing."

### Good enough is not really good enough
To spend your time training and only achieve the minimum standard is really disappointing. Approach the training with an outlook to excel: be physically ready, mentally prepared and have an open attitude to trying hard things.

Physically it is a good idea to be well above the entry requirements for two reasons: the kind of physical work you end up doing is not reflected by the level the entry requirements demand and more importantly, you will lose fitness during your training. Due to the scheduled as well as liability concerns, reservists are not able to engage in physical training outside of the training regieme. Coupled with the training scheduled not having very many (less than half a dozen) dedicated fitness classes you will need to need to be at a standard much higher so that as your fitness comes down, it will remain higher than the standard requires at the end.

Get used to eating the samey kind of food. Don't eat sugar.

It can be a bit harder to train mentally for the training. Forgo access to utilities like phones, watches and the Internet for extended periods (go on a holiday for a week and not use your phone?) and you find your mind begins to calm and let go of the useless things like what is happening on Facebook, Twitter or the news. Being comfortable in this mental state makes the training go faster and easier for the following reason:

## The whole thing is a game
That is not to say you should treat it like a game but you should definitely accept the type of training is not representative of the wider army. This initial foray into the defence force world is designed to get you used to some of the pressures that you may experience and situations you may encounter. The challenge is to be able to separate the 'you' that exists in everyday life, and the 'you' that is getting up at dark o'clock, working for 18 hours then going back to bed. You 'win' this game by meeting all the competencies and not shooting yourself.

The staff know it is a game too. They know they have a roll to play when they are yelling at you and when pushing you, getting you to so things that you might not normally do. Towards the end of training as things begin to relax somewhat they even call themselves on this, pointing out the cognitive dissonance everyone experiences when trying to process the whole experience.

There is a this weird vibe where both the recruits and the staff know this and have a back and forth about it. The game continues to e played regardless.

## There is a way and that way is good
Because of it's size, some aspects of training and development are steeped in arcane bureaucracy. Things are done because that is the way they are done. It should be noted that the soldiers executing the policy generally know that this policy/procedure is outmoded but have their hand forced. The PTIs for example, know that the exercises they are teaching and training for are at least 10 years behind their civilian counterparts but changes in pols/procs take a commensurate amount of time to filter down from review and control boards. Outside the realm of training, especially in operational theatre, the attitude of improvise, adapt and overcome takes over and the policies that are not helpful are quickly discarded.

## Final thoughts
To do well at this is straight forward. Try. That is it. As one instructor pointed out, "It's the easiest job in the world, just shut up and do what you are told". Just like getting pitched for programming work, ideas are cheap; it is the work that takes the effort.# Lessons learnt from joining the Australian Defence Force

I joined the ADF as a reservist. This is a journal of some of my experiences.

## Part 1: Specifics
<aside>
The term 'game' in this article refers to one that attempts to simulate an experience as someone tasked with overcoming an opposition with something: ostensibly an FPS, RPG or simulator and not so much tetris.

### Lesson: computer games prime you to approach problems in a bad way
When going through aptitude and attitude testing you are presented with various problems that look to see your approach to solving them vis-à-vis communication, command, respect, etc. The idea is to present you with some situations that you might encounter and then see how your (náive) approach will serve to solve the problem, work in a team and communicate and (in theory) execute intentions.

Computer games have very different outcomes in mind, crucially entertainment and engagement which, to that end, present problems and manage outcomes in a very different way than what real life demands.

This is not a bad thing in of itself, however it does have a major drawback: it primes you to approach problems with a false set of expectations and experiences that are at odds with reality - to your detriment.

This first manifests in the idea that you are special in your role and purpose. While you as an individual are special and loved, you as a soldier are not. You are subject to physical limitation, time constraints and don't re-spawn. In other words you are a real human in the real world with real strength and weaknesses. To mitigate this you need to work in and be part of a team that is supportive and works together. Two things of note follow from this: timing doesn't rotate around you and events do not fall to you.

If a computer game were to be made that followed, you would have to end up with a Real Life Simulator which is extremely boring. Take any first person shooter game and remove the pacing of enemy engagement to have it operate independent of the player and the whole thing falls apart. Have the special events (take the RPG and shoot down the enemy etc.) fall to any other character and you leave the player bored waiting for something to happen. Have the Player not involved in the main plot line and you just end up sitting near the side pointing your gun at civilians and bored out of your mind. You get no achievements in real life: there are no specific combinations of actions to get rewards.

Games work in an artificial world with artificial constraints.

### Lesson: problems are not perfectly solvable
A natural consequence that can fall out of rewards and achievements put in games is the idea all problems are perfectly solvable. Given a level in a game, many

All these aforementioned examples are essential to have in a game but in no way translate to the real world. Without prior experiences, it is all to easy to fall back to this illegitimate experience. To avoid the pitfalls associated with them you need to recognise that you might be affected by them and then put yourself in a position to have them challenged then reflect on your approach.

## Part two: obvious stuff
Government bodies take time to get things done. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. The adage 'Hurry up and wait' exists for a reason. On reflection: the army has ~30 thousand full-time soldiers and ~15 thousand part time soldiers<sup>[1][1]</sup> and organising them is a massive job which surprises me that it works at all. You need to accept that you are a number and will have to go through the process just like everyone else. The flip side of that is that because you are all a number, just like everyone else, you look to those next to you and humanise with them.

The Army will exploit you. But that is OK because you are exploiting them intern too, which is just like any other job. You are trading your time and experience for money. 'Nuff said.
