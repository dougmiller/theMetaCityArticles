Your client's site is old and kinda janky. Their processes are poorly run and inefficient. You could run your own version of the site 1000x better. Is it ethical to?

# Client is is still operating and you are still managing their account
No. Just no.

# Client is still operating but you are not managing their account
Maybe. Probably not.
What if they want you to manage their account again?

# Client has gone out of business
Sure.
