# When can you compete with a client?

Your client's site and business is run inefficiently. You could do it much better. Should you?

Your client's site is old and kinda janky. Their processes are poorly run and inefficient. You could run your own version of the site 1000x better. Is it ethical to?

# Client is is still operating and you are still managing their account
No. Just no.

# Client is still operating but you are not managing their account
Maybe. Probably not.
What if they want you to manage their account again?

# Client has gone out of business
Sure.


Turns out though, in a shock to no one, that improving on the technical aspect of a business site make very very little difference to the aspects of running an atual business.

Making the maintenance of the users on the site easier by redeveloping it is such a comparitivly minor aspect of all the things that actually go into the running of said business that you might as well not bother. Which is why it was not done. You would still need to workout your marketing, do sales, do support, do busines dev. Do all the things that make a business a business.

Devs gonna dev.
