# What happens if you don't use GitHub?
You tend to fall of some radars. This can be a blessing and a curse. You avoid all the recruiter rubbish that combs GitHub but you also do not get seen by people who you might want to have a legitimate profile for.

You also tend to fall off some other developers radars as GitHub became synonymous with Git itself. Conversations like, 'Where can I create a new file in Git' while browsing the GitHub repository. The pressure and dev cycle means that people feel they do not have the time to learn their tools fully and only learn an interface.

That is not to say that I have not used GitHub. It is a nice place for a read only copy of the repos that run the MetaCity as another endpoint for the distributed part of 'distributed VCS'.
