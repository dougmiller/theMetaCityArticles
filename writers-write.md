#Writers write

Writers write, photographers photograph, programmers program and runners run.

Just do. All the tools dont matter if you dont do the actual work of writing, running and programming. Excuses are grounded in reality (I do have a ten week old son) to look after but there is room to beat out your own brain telling you to do the lazy thing. To take the easy route.

That that is not what we are here to do.
