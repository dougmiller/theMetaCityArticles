Title:You are doing the DailyUI challenge wrong. Stop it.
Tags:Rant, Design Philosophy

TLDR: Most people putting up work for the #DailyUI challenge are not doing the *Design* part of the challenge. Most are doing *Art*. Which is fine but this is billed as a *Design* challenge. 

Where are the flows? Where are the accessibility considerations? Where is the UX design? Call out examples.


Bigger question: is design solved? Or are at least the design of the CRUD features 'solved'. Put in a design bank for each project and then run it through the style guide to add on colours and typography?
